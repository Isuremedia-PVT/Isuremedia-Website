const FAQS = [
  { q: 'What is a dedicated agency pod?', a: 'A dedicated agency pod is a fixed team assigned to one agency for recurring client delivery. It can include specialists such as SEO, PPC, web development, content, design, or automation, plus project management and quality control.' },
  { q: 'How is a dedicated pod different from project-based outsourcing?', a: 'Project-based outsourcing usually assigns work one project at a time, often with different people. A dedicated pod keeps the same team assigned to your agency so they retain knowledge of your standards, clients, tools, and working process.' },
  { q: 'What services can a dedicated agency pod cover?', a: 'A pod can be built around the services your agency sells, including SEO, PPC, web development, content, design, GoHighLevel, marketing automation, reporting, and QA.' },
  { q: 'How big is a typical agency pod?', a: 'Pod size depends on your service mix, client volume, project frequency, and workload. A pod may start with a small group of specialists and expand when your agency requires additional capacity.' },
  { q: 'Can I combine multiple services in one dedicated pod?', a: 'Yes. A multi-discipline pod can combine specialists across services such as SEO, PPC, web development, content, and automation when your agency needs one coordinated delivery team.' },
  { q: 'Do I get a dedicated project manager?', a: 'Yes. The pod can include a dedicated project manager who coordinates briefs, deadlines, specialist assignments, and communication so your agency has one accountable point of contact.' },
  { q: "Will the same people work on my agency's projects?", a: 'Yes. The purpose of a dedicated pod is continuity. The same assigned specialists continue working with your agency so they can build familiarity with your clients, standards, and processes.' },
  { q: "Can a dedicated pod work under my agency's brand?", a: 'Yes. A white label fulfillment team can deliver work behind your agency\'s brand while your agency remains the client-facing provider.' },
  { q: 'Can my clients know who is doing the work?', a: 'The default white-label model keeps the fulfillment team behind your agency. Client-facing communication and deliverables can be routed through your agency according to the agreed process.' },
  { q: 'How does pricing work for a dedicated agency pod?', a: 'Pricing depends on the number and type of specialists, expected workload, service mix, project volume, and management requirements. A pod is generally structured around recurring capacity rather than pricing each task from scratch.' },
  { q: 'Can I scale the pod up or down?', a: 'Yes. Pod size and scope can be reviewed as your client volume changes. This allows your agency to adjust fulfillment capacity without rebuilding the entire team.' },
  { q: 'How long does it take to get a dedicated pod running?', a: 'The setup period depends on the pod composition, brand standards, tools, access, and onboarding requirements. The first project also serves as a calibration period before the ongoing delivery rhythm is established.' },
  { q: 'Can I use a dedicated pod if I already have an in-house team?', a: 'Yes. A pod can supplement an internal team by handling overflow work, specialist services, or recurring production your existing staff does not have capacity to manage.' },
  { q: 'What happens when a project requires a specialist outside our pod?', a: 'The account manager can review the requirement and determine whether the pod needs an additional specialist, a temporary resource, or a change in composition based on the work involved.' },
  { q: 'Do dedicated agency pods require a long-term contract?', a: "Not necessarily. The engagement can be structured around recurring capacity and reviewed as your agency's needs change. Month-to-month arrangements may be available depending on the agreed setup." },
